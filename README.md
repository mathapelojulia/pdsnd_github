# **Exploring US Bike Share Data**
In this project, we use Python to explore data related to the bike share systems of three major cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and compute descriptive statistics. We run a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.

# **Datasets**[](https://)
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files contain the same core six columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also provide the additional following two columns:

* Gender

* Birth Year

# **Files**[](https://)
Data used in this project is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a national bike share system provider. In order to run the program, the following files are needed.

* chicago.csv

* new_york_city.csv

* washington.csv

# **Software**[](https://)
The program was written using:

* Python 3

* NumPy and Pandas were installed using Anaconda

* A text editor, like Atom
